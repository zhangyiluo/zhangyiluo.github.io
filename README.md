Thanks for here. I build this project for learn how to play with GitHub Pages and how to write CSS. Just learn and keep going.

# How to play with GitHub Pages

* First thing, [Getting started with GitHub Pages](
https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages).
*   Second thing, learn how to write README.md. This file is
"Markdown" style, a plain text formatting syntax, See the [Syntax Page.](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
By the way， Web site named DaringFireBall sounds so funny.  :)
* Third thing， [Select a theme to publish my site with a Jekyll theme](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser). 

# How to write CSS 

It's a so big project , here is [CSS Home](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).

* First thing, [Starting with HTML + CSS.](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/011/firstcss)

* Last thing, When CSS job done , needs a [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
