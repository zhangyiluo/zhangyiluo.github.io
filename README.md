# For What

Thanks for here. I build this project for learn how to play with GitHub Pages and how to write CSS. Just learn and keep going.

# How to play with GitHub Pages

* First thing, [Getting started with GitHub Pages](
https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages).
*   Second thing, learn how to write README.md. This file is
"Markdown" style, a plain text formatting syntax, See the [Syntax Page.](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
By the way， Web site named DaringFireBall sounds so funny.  :)
* Third thing， [Select a theme to publish my site with a Jekyll theme](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser). This Web site choise  jekyll-theme-dinky. Default looks beautyful. I do not plan to study theme syntax , just default, Fine.

# How to write CSS 

It's a so big project , here is [CSS Home](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).

* First thing, [Starting with HTML + CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/011/firstcss/). When CSS finished , needs a [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

* [CSS Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) is an important thing. It can used to design and layout. Sometimes you have to calculate exactly.

* Here is the [first practice](index1.html).

Sorry, to understand How is CSS workd wonderfully, I must learn more Basic knowledge, like HTML. So,  

# How to write HTML 

* Almost spent 3 days to [Study HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).  

* So, know about that [HTML supports 140 standard color names](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).

* Continue CSS, Color is useful. so [CSS Color](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_colors.asp) is point.

* Learn a new framework，Modern Responsive CSS，I try to [do some practice here](index2.html)
