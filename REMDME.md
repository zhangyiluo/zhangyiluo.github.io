# For What

Thanks for here. I build this project for learn how to play with GitHub Pages and how to write CSS. Just learn and keep going.

# How to play with GitHub Pages

* First thing, [Getting started with GitHub Pages](
https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages)
*   Second thing, learn how to write README.md. This file is
"Markdown" style, a plain text formatting syntax, See the [Syntax Page.](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
By the way， Web site named DaringFireBall sounds so funny.  :)

# How to write CSS 

It's a so big project , here is [CSS Home.](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).

* First thing, [Starting with HTML + CSS.](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/011/firstcss)
